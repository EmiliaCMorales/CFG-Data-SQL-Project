# Course Final Project
This repository contains my final project that I created in a team of 5. It is a database that contains details of bookings made at a made-up travel agency, Getaways.com
The [Getaways_project.sql](https://github.com/EmiliaCMorales/CFG-Data-SQL-Project/blob/main/Getaways%20Project.sql) script contains the code used to create and populate the tables & the [Getaways_Tasks.sql](https://github.com/EmiliaCMorales/CFG-Data-SQL-Project/blob/main/Getaways%20Tasks.sql) script contains the code used to complete the core & advanced requirement tasks we were asked to complete such as creating views, stored functions, data visualization etc. 
The repository also contains a backup of the database ([Getaways_backupfile.sql](https://github.com/EmiliaCMorales/CFG-Data-SQL-Project/blob/main/Getaways%20Backupfile.sql). 
The project was presented on Week 8 to the rest of the group (remotely) ([presentation.pdf](https://github.com/EmiliaCMorales/CFG-Data-SQL-Project/blob/main/Presentation.pdf).
